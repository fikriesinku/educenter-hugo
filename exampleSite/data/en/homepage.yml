    first point of contact for Ethiopian-Eritrean immigrants wanting to gain entry
    level UK qualifications by giving them professional bilingual support and advice
    tailored to their needs, cultural background and career interests on a case by
    case basis since no two cases are the same given the diversity of migrants. It

  title: Success Stories
  content: 'After seeking asylum in the UK in 2017 and granted refugee status in 2018,
    I went on completing an M.Sc. degree at University of Warwick and then completed
    a brief work experience in London. Throughout this time, I''ve personally assisted
    dozens of people on the way made me acutely aware of the difficulty of navigating
    the immigration, education and career system for people speaking limited English.
    Worked as an instructor in a higher education in Ethiopia and being able to speak
    Ethiopian languages added to understanding of what educational and cultural system
    Ethiopian-Eritrean migrants came from, Iâ€™ve the passion and knowledge to support
    others study, test and qualify by partnering with appropriate institutions and
    signposting them when necessary.  '
