## ABOUT OUR JOURNY

We're starting as a small community of dedicated to recruit, brokerage and upskill people. We're working closely with the community and it is both the end the beginning of our journey. Meanwhile, we collaborate with training providers recognised in the industry to deliver the skills training while our recruitment is informed by the needs of employers and the wider economic situation in the region and we work with recognised trainers to fill the skill needs of our candidates.
